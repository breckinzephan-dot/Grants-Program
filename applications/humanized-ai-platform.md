## 1. Project Overview

**Overview**

LumeAI is a decentralized platform designed to anchor AI-generated content (text, image, and video metadata) on-chain to ensure authenticity, traceability, and transparent ownership.  
It helps creators, marketers, and developers verify AI content provenance while enabling privacy-preserving storage through IPFS and Substrate-based smart modules.

The core idea is to make AI-generated content undetectable and verifiable, empowering creators in DeFi, NFT, and digital marketing spaces.

---

## 2. Project Details

### Problem
AI content authenticity is becoming a critical challenge. Deepfakes, plagiarism, and unverified AI usage erode trust across digital platforms.  
Centralized verification services are prone to censorship and single points of failure.

### Solution
LumeAI leverages Polkadot’s interoperable network and Substrate to create a decentralized verification layer for AI-generated content.  
Each content hash is anchored on-chain using a custom **`storeContent` pallet**, enabling:
- Tamper-proof verification
- Interoperability with other Polkadot parachains
- Transparent provenance tracking
- Optional encrypted metadata storage via IPFS

### Technical Architecture

**Stack Overview**
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express  
- **Blockchain Layer:** Substrate SDK, Polkadot-JS API  
- **Storage:** IPFS (for optional content anchoring)  
- **Smart Module:** Custom Substrate pallet (`storeContent`)

**Workflow**
1. User generates content (text/image/video).  
2. LumeAI hashes content metadata locally.  
3. Hash is stored on-chain via Substrate pallet.  
4. Optional IPFS storage of the actual content.  
5. On-chain record is queryable by creators, brands, or verifiers.

### Deployment Plan
The `storeContent` pallet will be deployed as part of a parachain connected to the **Polkadot Relay Chain**.  
This setup enables:
- Shared security  
- XCM-based cross-chain verification  
- Integration with existing content or NFT parachains

Initial testing will run on a local Substrate node and Kusama testnet.  
Full deployment will follow a parachain slot auction for mainnet hosting.

## 3. Ecosystem Fit

### Target Users
- AI creators & agencies using generative tools  
- NFT marketplaces ensuring content authenticity  
- DeFi projects needing proof-of-origin for media assets

### Ecosystem Impact
LumeAI directly increases **DOT** utility by:
1. **Parachain Slot Auctions:** bonding DOT (500K+ typical) for 2-year leases  
2. **Transaction Fees:** on-chain anchoring incurs DOT usage  
3. **Staking & Governance:** users participate in parachain validation  
4. **Ecosystem Growth:** onboarding creators from Web2 into Polkadot

By making AI content verifiable and interoperable, LumeAI strengthens Polkadot’s creative and data layers.

## 4. Development Status

Nothing has been built yet — the project is currently in the **planning and architecture stage**.  
However, early scaffolding work has begun on:
- Frontend repo setup  
- Substrate pallet draft design (`storeContent`)  
- CI pipeline configuration

All deliverables for this milestone will be new and open-sourced.

## 8. Development Roadmap

### **Milestone 1 — Core MVP Implementation**
**Estimated Duration:** 5 weeks  
**Cost:** $15,000  

| Deliverable | Description | Technology | Output |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 1. Technical Architecture & Setup | Define repo structure, install dependencies, CI/CD setup | GitHub, Substrate SDK | Public repo initialized |
| 2. Pallet Development | Build `storeContent` pallet with hash storage and retrieval | Rust, Substrate FRAME | Functional pallet module |
| 3. Frontend Integration | Create UI for content upload and hash verification | React / Next.js | Demo web interface |
| 4. API Layer | Node.js bridge between frontend and Substrate RPC | Node.js, Polkadot-JS API | RESTful API endpoints |
| 5. Testing & Documentation | Unit + integration tests, detailed README | Jest, Mocha | Verified test results + docs |
| 6. Demo Video | Showcase content submission and on-chain verification | — | 3–5 min demo video |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Pallet compiles and runs on local node  
- Frontend can successfully anchor and retrieve hashes  
- Code open-sourced under Apache 2.0  
- Basic tests and documentation complete

---

## 9. Future Plans
Following Milestone 1, LumeAI aims to:
- Expand to **multi-modal AI content verification**
- Integrate **cross-chain metadata sharing** via XCM
- Launch a **creator dashboard** for managing anchored content
- Partner with NFT marketplaces for provenance validation

---

## 10. Additional Information

LumeAI’s goal aligns with Polkadot’s mission of interoperability and security — bringing decentralized verification tools to creators globally.  
This grant will enable the initial MVP required for broader ecosystem adoption.
