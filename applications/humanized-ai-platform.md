# Humanized AI Platform

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Humanized AI Platform  
**Team Name:** BreckinZephan Labs  
**Website (if any):** Coming soon  
**Linked Repositories:** https://github.com/breckinzephan-dot/humanized-ai-platform  
**Grant Category:** Open Source Software / AI Integration  

### Project Description

Humanized AI is a Web3-based platform that blends artificial intelligence with blockchain transparency to create an open, ethical, and decentralized ecosystem for intelligent automation.  
The project aims to make AI tools more “humanized” — transparent, accountable, and community-driven — while allowing developers and businesses to build and interact with AI agents safely.

We will build a decentralized web app and open-source SDK that allows creators and organizations to integrate intelligent automation into their operations while maintaining full data privacy and traceability on-chain.

## Project Goals

1. **Transparency in AI** – Provide blockchain-backed proof of how AI models process and output data.  
2. **Data Ownership** – Give users full control of their personal and interaction data.  
3. **AI + Web3 Integration** – Enable smart contracts to interact directly with AI models through our SDK.  
4. **Community Collaboration** – Allow developers to extend and contribute to open AI modules.
