## 1. Project Overview

**Overview**

LumeAI is a decentralized platform designed to anchor AI-generated content (text, image, and video metadata) on-chain to ensure authenticity, traceability, and transparent ownership.  
It helps creators, marketers, and developers verify AI content provenance while enabling privacy-preserving storage through IPFS and Substrate-based runtime modules.

The goal is to make AI-generated content **verifiable and trustable** while maintaining creator privacy — empowering digital creators, NFT projects, and Web3 marketers.

---

## 2. Project Details

### Problem

AI content authenticity is becoming a critical challenge. Deepfakes, plagiarism, and unverified AI usage erode trust across digital platforms.  
Existing centralized verification systems are vulnerable to censorship, manipulation, and single points of failure.

### Solution

LumeAI leverages **Polkadot’s interoperable network** and **Substrate** to build a decentralized verification layer for AI-generated content.  
Each content hash is anchored on-chain using a custom **`storeContent` pallet**, which enables:

- Tamper-proof verification  
- Interoperability with other Polkadot parachains  
- Transparent provenance tracking  
- Optional encrypted content storage using IPFS  

This ensures every piece of AI-generated media can be traced to its verified source.

---

### Technical Architecture

**Stack Overview:**
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express  
- **Blockchain Layer:** Substrate SDK, Polkadot-JS API  
- **Storage:** IPFS for off-chain content anchoring  
- **Smart Module:** Custom Substrate pallet (`storeContent`)

**Workflow:**
1. User generates content (text/image/video).  
2. LumeAI hashes content metadata locally.  
3. Hash is stored on-chain via Substrate pallet.  
4. Optional IPFS storage of the actual content.  
5. On-chain record is verifiable by creators, agencies, and partners.

---

### Deployment Plan

The **`storeContent` pallet** will be deployed as part of a parachain connected to the **Polkadot Relay Chain**.  
Testing will be done first on a **local Substrate node** and **Kusama testnet** before preparing for Polkadot mainnet deployment.

This setup provides:
- Shared security  
- Cross-chain interoperability via XCM  
- Seamless integration with NFT and content parachains  

---

## 3. Ecosystem Fit

### Target Users
- AI creators & content agencies  
- NFT marketplaces verifying originality  
- DeFi and media platforms ensuring asset authenticity  

### Ecosystem Impact
LumeAI contributes to Polkadot’s ecosystem by:
1. Encouraging **DOT utility** through transaction fees.  
2. Driving adoption of **Substrate** for decentralized content verification.  
3. Expanding Polkadot’s presence in **AI and creative industries**.  
4. Creating an open infrastructure for verifiable digital creativity.

---

## 4. Development Status

Nothing has been built yet — the project is currently in the **architecture and planning stage**.  
Initial preparation includes:
- Frontend scaffolding and repo setup  
- Pallet design draft (`storeContent`)  
- CI/CD configuration plan  

All deliverables for the first milestone will be new and open-sourced.
